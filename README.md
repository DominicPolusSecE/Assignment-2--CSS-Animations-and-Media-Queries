This is a responsive anime-themed landing page that contains vibrant colours, dynamic imagery, and subtle animations to make this a great user-facing experience. It looks to have an anime-inspired bright colour scheme (with lots of colour and also mainly colours red and yellow), there is a full page background image and a big hot 'Start Watching' button leading to an external streaming site. Hover effects on links in the genre section lead to the popular anime genres (Action, Romance, Fantasy, Slice of Life).

It is also fully responsive, dependent on CSS media queries from desktop, tablet or mobile devices. Helping facilitate a delightful user experience without adding confusion, is by creating smooth animations such as a text fade-in and button scaling. It reflects the nature of the fun and anime energetic, in a clean and visually catchy layout for users to go and enjoy.
